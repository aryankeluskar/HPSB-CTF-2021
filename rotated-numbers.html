    Ahh you see there are many ways a website can store your data, one of the most common way is localStorage
    <p>
        The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can do Inspect Element and use console to access localStorage
    </p>
    <p>
        To read the data, simply enter "localStorage.getItem('myCat');"<br> where myCat is the name of the variable
    </p>
    <p>
        Some more general knowledge: The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions
        down the alphabet. Lets assume we use Shift of 5 for this entire competetion.
    </p>
    <p>
        my favourite website for encoding and decoding caeser ciphers is https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher

        i wonder if anything is hidden in the localStorage ðŸ¤”
